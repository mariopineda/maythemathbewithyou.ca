[`minimal-mistakes-jekyll`](https://rubygems.org/gems/minimal-mistakes-jekyll) can only be used with Jekyll proper. If you're hosting on GitHub Pages or using that gem the theme won't work. 3rd party themes haven't been white-listed so it's a no go for now.

Fine with all that? Great. Let's continue.

If you're migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven't customized any of the `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass` partials, or `assets` this should be quick and painless.

## Step 1: Remove Theme Files 

Remove `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, `assets` folders and files within. You won't need these anymore as they're bundled in the theme.

If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as [overrides](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) to the versions bundled with the theme.

## Step 2: Update `Gemfile`

Replace `gem &quot;github-pages` or `gem &quot;jekyll&quot;` with `gem &quot;jekyll&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 3.3.0&quot;`. You'll need the latest version of Jekyll[^update-jekyll] for Minimal Mistakes to work and load all of the /assets/ properly.

[^update-jekyll]: You could also run `bundle update jekyll` to update Jekyll.

Add the Minimal Mistakes theme gem: 

```ruby
gem &quot;minimal-mistakes-jekyll&quot;
```

When finished your `Gemfile` should look something like this:

```ruby
source &quot;https://rubygems.org&quot;

gem &quot;jekyll&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 3.3.0&quot;
gem &quot;minimal-mistakes-jekyll&quot;
```

## Step 3: Run Bundler

Run `bundle install` (or `bundle update` if you're updating an existing repo) to install/update Jekyll and the theme.

## Step 4: Install the Theme

Add `theme: &quot;minimal-mistakes-jekyll&quot;` to your `_config.yml` file.

If you're migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn't have to change anything else after this. If it's a new site consult then docs to [properly config]({{ &quot;/docs/configuration/&quot; | relative_url }}).

**Please Note:** Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, [galleries]({{ &quot;/docs/helpers/#gallery&quot; | relative_url }}), and [feature rows]({{ &quot;/docs/helpers/#feature-row&quot; | relative_url }}) have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just `image: filename.jpg` you'll need to use the full path eg: `image: assets/images/filename.jpg`. The preferred location is now `assets/images` but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This all applies for image references in `_config.yml` and `author.yml` as well.
{: .notice--danger}

## Step 5: `jekyll new` Tweaks

If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to `_data/` and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.

- [`_data/ui-text.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/ui-text.yml) - UI text [documentation]({{ &quot;/docs/ui-text/&quot; | relative_url }})
- [`_data/navigation.yml`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml) - navigation [documentation]({{ &quot;/docs/navigation/&quot; | relative_url }})

You'll also need to: 

- Replace `&lt;site root&gt;/index.html` with a modified [Minimal Mistakes `index.html`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/index.html).
- Change `layout: post` in `_posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown` to `layout: single`.
- Remove `about.md`, or at the very least change `layout: page` to `layout: single` and remove references to `icon-github.html` (or [copy to your `_includes`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_includes) if using).

---

That's it! If all goes well running `bundle exec jekyll serve` should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you're testing the pre-release Ruby gem version.

Gone are the days of forking a repo just to &quot;install it&quot;. Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to &quot;upgrade it&quot;.

If you're interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:

1. Support for a theme `assets` folder was recently [added to Jekyll core](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5364), but has yet to be released or rolled into the `github-pages` gem. Meaning you can't use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet... locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don't mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll. 
2. Windows users can't currently use themes packaged as gems due to a [bug with file paths](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5192) in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a [fix is on the way](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/5256) soon.

Fine with all that? Great. Let's continue.

If you're migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven't customized any of the `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass` partials, or `assets` this should be quick and painless.

## Step 1: Remove Theme Files 

Remove `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, `assets` folders and files within. You won't need these anymore as they're bundled in the theme.

## Step 2: Update `Gemfile`

In order to test you'll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes.

Start by replacing `gem &quot;github-pages&quot;` or `gem &quot;jekyll&quot;` with the following:

```ruby
gem &quot;jekyll&quot;, :git =&gt; &quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git&quot;
```

Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem: 

```ruby
gem &quot;minimal-mistakes-jekyll&quot;, :git =&gt; &quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git&quot;, :branch =&gt; &quot;feature/theme-gem&quot;`
```

When finished your `Gemfile` should look something like this:

```ruby
source &quot;https://rubygems.org&quot;

gem &quot;jekyll&quot;, :git =&gt; &quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git&quot;
gem &quot;minimal-mistakes-jekyll&quot;, :git =&gt; &quot;https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git&quot;, :branch =&gt; &quot;feature/theme-gem&quot;

group :jekyll_plugins do
  # gem &quot;jekyll-archives&quot;
  gem &quot;jekyll-paginate&quot;
  gem &quot;jekyll-sitemap&quot;
  gem &quot;jekyll-gist&quot;
  gem &quot;jekyll-feed&quot;
  gem &quot;jemoji&quot;
end
```

## Step 3: Run Bundler

Run `bundle install` (or `bundle update` if you're updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems.

## Step 4: Install the Theme

Add `theme: &quot;minimal-mistakes-jekyll&quot;` to your `_config.yml` file.

If you're migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn't have to change anything else after this. If it's a new site consult then docs to [properly config]({{ &quot;/docs/configuration/&quot; | relative_url }}).

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.[^1]

[^1]: &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting&gt;

### GFM Code Blocks

GitHub Flavored Markdown [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) are supported. To modify styling and highlight colors edit `/_sass/syntax.scss`.

```css
#container {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 -240px 0 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

{% highlight scss %}
.highlight {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 1em;
  font-family: $monospace;
  font-size: $type-size-7;
  line-height: 1.8;
}
{% endhighlight %}

```html
{% raw %}&lt;nav class=&quot;pagination&quot; role=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
  {% if page.previous %}
    &lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.url }}{{ page.previous.url }}&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot; title=&quot;{{ page.previous.title }}&quot;&gt;Previous article&lt;/a&gt;
  {% endif %}
  {% if page.next %}
    &lt;a href=&quot;{{ site.url }}{{ page.next.url }}&quot; class=&quot;btn&quot; title=&quot;{{ page.next.title }}&quot;&gt;Next article&lt;/a&gt;
  {% endif %}
&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;!-- /.pagination --&gt;{% endraw %}
```

```ruby
module Jekyll
  class TagIndex &lt; Page
    def initialize(site, base, dir, tag)
      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = 'index.html'
      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'tag_index.html')
      self.data['tag'] = tag
      tag_title_prefix = site.config['tag_title_prefix'] || 'Tagged: '
      tag_title_suffix = site.config['tag_title_suffix'] || '&amp;#8211;'
      self.data['title'] = &quot;#{tag_title_prefix}#{tag}&quot;
      self.data['description'] = &quot;An archive of posts tagged #{tag}.&quot;
    end
  end
end
```

### Code Blocks in Lists

Indentation matters. Be sure the indent of the code block aligns with the first non-space character after the list item marker (e.g., `1.`). Usually this will mean indenting 3 spaces instead of 4.

1. Do step 1.
2. Now do this:
   
   ```ruby
   def print_hi(name)
     puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;
   end
   print_hi('Tom')
   #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
   ```
        
3. Now you can do this.

### Jekyll Highlight Tag

An example of a code blocking using Jekyll's [`{% raw %}{% highlight %}{% endraw %}` tag](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting).

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
// 'gulp html' -- does nothing
// 'gulp html --prod' -- minifies and gzips HTML files for production
gulp.task('html', () =&gt; {
  return gulp.src(paths.siteFolderName + paths.htmlPattern)
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, htmlmin({
      removeComments: true,
      collapseWhitespace: true,
      collapseBooleanAttributes: false,
      removeAttributeQuotes: false,
      removeRedundantAttributes: false,
      minifyJS: true,
      minifyCSS: true
    })))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, size({title: 'optimized HTML'})))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, gulp.dest(paths.siteFolderName)))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, gzip({append: true})))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, size({
      title: 'gzipped HTML',
      gzip: true
    })))
    .pipe(when(argv.prod, gulp.dest(paths.siteFolderName)))
});
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight wl linenos %}
Module[{},

]
{% endhighlight %}

### GitHub Gist Embed

An example of a Gist embed below.

If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

### Figures (for images or video)

#### One Up

&lt;figure&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_c.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

Retro Bushwick keytar cliche. Before they sold out sustainable gastropub Marfa readymade, ethical Williamsburg skateboard brunch qui consectetur gentrify semiotics. Mustache cillum irony, fingerstache magna pour-over keffiyeh tousled selfies.

#### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/image-filename-1-large.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/image-filename-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/images/image-filename-2-large.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/image-filename-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Caption describing these two images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Two images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

#### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/image-filename-1.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/image-filename-2.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/image-filename-3.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Caption describing these three images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

&lt;figure class=&quot;third&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg&quot;&gt;

## Blockquotes

Single line blockquote:

&gt; Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:

&gt; People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.

&lt;cite&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/cite&gt; --- Apple Worldwide Developers' Conference, 1997

The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started.

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg){: .align-center}

The image above happens to be **centered**.

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg){: .align-left} The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we'll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it's thing. Mission accomplished!

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

![no-alignment]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg)

The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg){: .align-right}

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don't care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don't let anyone else tell you differently.

In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah --- Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.

And just when you thought we were done, we're going to do them all over again with captions!

&lt;figure class=&quot;align-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-580x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 

The figure above happens to be **centered**. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.

&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 150px&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-150x150.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Itty-bitty caption.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 

The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is **left aligned**.

As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too.

And now for a **massively large image**. It also has **no alignment**.

&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 1200px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Massive image comment for your eyeballs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 

The figure element above has an inline style of `width: 1200px` set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.

&lt;figure style=&quot;width: 300px&quot; class=&quot;align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image-alignment-300x200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Feels good to be right all the time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 

And now we're going to shift things to the **right align**. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there --- Hey guy!

This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.

### Left Align

This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it's views. It's favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.
{: style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;}

### Center Align

This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.
{: style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;}

### Right Align

This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it's views. It's prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it's a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.
{: style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;}

### Justify Align

This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it's place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.

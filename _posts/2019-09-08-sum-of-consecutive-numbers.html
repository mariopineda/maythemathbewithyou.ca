<p>Use deductive reasoning to prove that the sum of three consecutive even numbers is divisible by six.</p>

  <div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-header" id="headingOne">
        <h5 class="mb-0">
          <button class="btn btn-link" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseOne">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
          </button>
        </h5>
      </div>
      <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordionExample">
        <div class="card-body">
          <!--- Start solution --->
          <p>If $n$ is a whole number, then $2n$ is an even number and $2n+(2n+2)+(2n+4)+(2n+6)+(2n+8)+(2n+10)$ is a sum of six consequtive even numbers. This expression can be simplified to: $12n+30 = 6(2n+5)$. Since we were able to factor out 6 it means the sum must be divisible by 6.</p>
          <!--- End solution --->

<p>Bird banding is one of the most useful tools in the study of wild birds. Wild birds are captured and marked, usually with a numbered metal band placed on the leg. The bander records information about the bird, as well as where and when it was banded. Data from recovered bands provide information on the distribution and movement of species, their relative numbers, annual production, life span, and causes of death. Such information increases our knowledge and understanding of birds and their habits and helps us to manage and conserve them.</p>

<p>For all birds, except hummingbirds, bands carry a unique 8 or 9 digit number which consists of two parts - a 3 digit prefix and a 5 to 6 digit suffix. The prefix consists of a two digit variable series number and cannot start with a zero. The third digit in the prefix is a band size indicator digit between 0 and 9.</p>

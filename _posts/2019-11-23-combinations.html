<p>As an athlete on a plant-based diet you need to ensure an adequate protein intake. Your coach has instructed you that your post-workout meal has to contain 1 soy-based source of protein, 2 different legume-based proteins, and three different nut-based sources of protein. Determine the number of possible post-workout meals that can be made from 2 different soy-based dishes, 5 different legume dishes and 9 different nut varieties.</p>

          <p>The order of the different dishes does not matter. $\binom{2}{1} \times \binom{5}{2} \times \binom{9}{3} = 1690$ different post-workout meals.</p>

<p>Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms.<p>

<p>Since 1993 scientific satellites have accuratelly measured sea levels changes. Data from these satellite shows that the sea levels have risen by 94.4 mm (as of May 2019). Determine the average rate of change in the sea level during this time period in mm / year.</p>

            <li>13 tonnes = 13000 kg. Unit rate for flying: $\displaystyle\frac{13000}{100} = 130$ kg of CO2 emissions / person. Unit rate for driving: 186 kg of CO2 emissions / person. Flying has the lower unit rate of CO2 emissions.</li>
            <li>Rate for a family of 4 persons when flying: $130 \times 4 = 520$ kg of CO2 emissions / 4 persons. Rate for a family of 4 persons when driving: $186$ kg of CO2 emissions / 4 persons. Note that here we assume that the CO2 emissions for the vehicle is independet of the number of passengers.

<p>Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues of our time. Climate change is caused by the increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These increases are primarily due to human activities such as the use of fossil fuels or agriculture. In 2017, the oil and gas sector was the largest source of GHG emissions in Canada, accounting for 27% of total national emissions. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the Canada oil sands between the years 1990 and 2017 can be modelled by the following quadratic equations $e(t) = 0.081284t^2-323.345t+321577$ where $e(t)$ is the CO2 emissions in megatonnes and $t$ is the year. </p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Determine the CO2 emissions from the oil sands in 1990. </li>
  <li>Determine in what year the emissions doubled compared to the 1990 emission levels.</li>
  <li>$-0.5x^2+x+7=2-x$</li>
  <li>$3x^2-3x-8=8x+1$</li>
</ol>

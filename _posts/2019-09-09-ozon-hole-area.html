<p>The ozone layer is a region of Earth's atmosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. Certain human-made chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) create a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica each spring. The size of the ozon hole between the years 1979 and 2018 can be modelled by the cubuc function \[a=0.001787t^3-0.1324t^2+3.1576t-0.8924\] where \[t\] is the year since 1979 and \[a\] is the average area of the ozon hole in millions of square kilometers.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Sketch the function describing the area of the ozon hole. Label the axes appropriatelly. What are your window settings?</li>
  <li>Determine the size of the ozon hole in 1979 and in 2018. How many times larger was the area in 2018 compared to 1979?</li>
  <li>What is an appropriate domain and range for this context? Round quantities to the nearest thousand if necessary</li>
  <li>The total land area of Canada is 9093507 $\mbox{km}^2$. Which year did the size of the ozon hole become larger than the land area of Canada?</li>

          <h3>A.</h3>
          <img src="http://maythemathbewithyou.com/tex/seasonl-sea-ice-extent.png">
          <h3>B.</h3>
          Maximum sea ice area $= 15.017$ million km$^2$.
          <h3>C.</h3>
          Minimum sea ice area $= 5.944$ million km$^2$.
          <h3>D.</h3>
          The x-coordinate of the maximum is 3.076..., hence during March the sea ice covered the largest area.
          <h3>E.</h3>
          The x-coordinate of the minimum is 9.483..., hence during September the sea ice covered the smallest area.
          <h3>F.</h3>
          Domain: ${m | 1 \leq m \leq 12, x \in R}$ or $[1,12]$ and Range: ${A | 0 \leq A \leq 15, A \in R}$ or $[0, 15]$. Other answers are possible.
          <h3>G.</h3>
          Graph $A(m)$ and add a horizontal line as second function $Y_2=9.093507$. Determine the m-coordinates of the points of intersection of the two functions. The m-xoordinates of the points of intersection are $m_1=6.94...$ and $m_2=11.47$, so the sea ice area was larger than the land area of Canada between January and end on June (month 6) and between mid November (month 11) and December 31.

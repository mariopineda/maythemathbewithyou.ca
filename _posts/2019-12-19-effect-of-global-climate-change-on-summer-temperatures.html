<p>One effect global climate change is has been causing over the in the Northern Hemisphere is a shift in summer temperatures toward more extreme temperatures. In a series of studies betwen 1951 and 2015 scientist compared actual summer temperatures for each decade since the 1980s to the summer temperatures between 1951 to 1980. During the base period, 1951 to 1980 the mean and standard deviation summer temperature was scaled to $\bar{x}=0$ and the $\sigma=1$. During the years 2005 - 2015 $\bar{x}=1.5$ and $\sigma=1.4$</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Explain what the changes in the mean and standard deviation between the baseline years and 2005 - 2015 mean in this context.</li>
  <li>Determine the probability of an above average summer temperature day in 1980?</li>
  <li>Determine the probability of an above average summer temperature day in 2015?</li>
  <li>The researchers defined an "extremely hot" day as 3 standard deviations above the mean. Determine the probability of an extremely hot day in 1980 mand in 2015. </li>
</ol>

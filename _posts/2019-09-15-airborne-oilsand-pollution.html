<p>A recent study by researchers at University of Alberta showed that a single oil sands upgrading facility in the Fort MacMurry region released 11400 metric tonnes of airborne pollutants during a four month period in 2008. The research detected elevated concentrations of highly toxic heavy metals and organic chemicals in fresh snow several hundred kilometers away from the upgrading facility. The concentration of lead pollution deposited on fresh snow can me modelled with the following decreasing exponental function $y(x) = 54.6 \times 0.97^x$ where $x$ is the distance from the upgrading facility in kilometers and $y$ is the concentration of lead in fresh snow in $\mu$g (micrograms) per square meter.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>The exponential function describing the lead concentration can be written in the form $y=a \times b^x$.
    <ol>
      <li>What is the value of the parameter $a$? What does the $a$-value represent within this context? What are the units of the a-value?</li>
      <li>What is the value of the parameter $b$? What does the $b$-value represent within this context? What are the units of the b-value?</li>
      </ol>
  <li>The average background level of lead in the environment (in the absence of pollution) is approximatelly 1.4 $\mu$g/m$^2$. Determine at what distance from the upgrading facility the lead concentration was at the normal level.</li>
  <li>State a possible domain and range for the exponential function that could be used in this context.</li>
</ol>

          Let $x$ be the amount of discount you recieve on the book (in dollars), then when can use proportional reasoning to determine $x$ as follows, $\displaystyle\frac{part}{whole} \Rightarrow \displaystyle\frac{20}{100} = \displaystyle\frac{x}{24.50}$. By multiplying left and right hand side by 24.50 we get $x = \displaystyle\frac{20}{100} \times 24.50 = 4.90$. As an employee you get a discount of $\$4.90$ which means that you will be paying $\$19.60$ for the book ($24.50-4.90$).

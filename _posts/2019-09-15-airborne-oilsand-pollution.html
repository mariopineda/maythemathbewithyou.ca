<p>A recent study by researchers at University of Alberta showed that a single oil sands upgrading facility in the Fort MacMurry region released 11400 metric tonnes of airborne pollutants during a four month period in 2008. The research detected elevated concentrations of highly toxic heavy metals and organic chemicals in fresh snow several hundred kilometers away from the upgrading facility. The concentration of lead pollution deposited on fresh snow can me modelled with the following decreasing exponental function $y(x) = 54.6 \times 0.97^x$ where $x$ is the distance from the upgrading facility in kilometers and $y$ is the concentration of lead in fresh snow in $\mu$g (micrograms) per square meter.</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>The exponential function describing the lead concentration can be written in the form $y=a \times b^x$.
    <ol>
      <li>What is the value of the parameter $a$? What does the $a$-value represent within this context? What are the units of the a-value?</li>
      <li>What is the value of the parameter $b$? What does the $b$-value represent within this context?</li>
      </ol>
  <li>The average background level of lead in the environment (in the absence of pollution) is approximatelly 2.2 $\mu$g/m$^2$. Determine at what distance from the upgrading facility the lead concentration was back at the normal level. Round your answer to the nearest whole kilometer.</li>
  <li>How many times higher was the concentration of lead at the upgrading facility compared to the background level? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.</li>
  <li>State a possible domain and range for the exponential function describing the lead concentration between the upgrading facility and the point at which the lead concentration is back at the background level.</li>
</ol>

              <ol>
                <li>$a=54.6 \mu$g\m$^2$. $a$ represents the lead concentration at the upgrade facility (where the distace is zero, $x=0$)</li>
                <li>$b=0.97$. $b$ represents the rate of decay of the lead pollution, in this context the lead concentration declines by 3% for every kilometer ($(1-0.97)\times 100 = 3$).</li>
                </ol>
            <li>After graphing $y(x)$ add $y_2=2.2$ and find the x-coordinate of the point of intersection between ther two graphs (2nd+trace $\Rightarrow$ 5:intersect). The distance at which the lead concentration is back at background levels is 105 km away from the upgrading facility.</li>
            <li>Divide the lead concentration at the upgrade facility (54.6 $\mu$g \ m$^2$) by the background level 2.2 $\mu$g/m$^2$, $\displaystyle\frac{54.6}{2.2} = 24.\bar{81} \approx 25$ times higher.</li>
            <li>Domain: $\{ x | 0 \leq x \leq 105, x \in \mathbb{R} \}$. Range: $\{y | 2.2 \leq y \leq 54.6\}$</li>

<p>William Nordhaus is an American economist, best known for his work in economic modelling and climate change. Nordhaus recieved the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for developing a model describing the interplay between the economy and the climate.</p>

<p>One action that governments could take to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere is to levy a tax on fossil fuel. This tax would be based on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the air when burning fossil fuels. The cost-benefit equation $\ln (1-P) = -0.0034-0.0053x$ models the approximate relationship between a tax of $x$ dollars per ton of carbon emissions and the corresponding percent reduction $P$ (in decimal form) </p>

<ol type=A>
  <li>Write $P$ as a function of $x$ (algebraically solve for $P$).</li>
  <li>Graph $P$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1000$ and $-1 \leq P \leq 0$.</li>
  <li>What does the x and y-axis represent?</li>
  <li>Determine the reduction, to the nearest whole percent, when the cost for carbon emissions are $60 per ton.</li>
  <li>What cost per ton would give a 50% reduction in carbon emissions.</li>
  <li>Using the graph of the model, discuss the benefits and disadvantages of continuing to raise taxes on carbon emissions.</li>
</ol>

          <h3>A.</h3>
          <p>Solve $\ln (1-P) = -0.0034-0.0053x$ for $P$ by converting to exponential form, $\e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}=1-P$. Add $P$ to both sides, $\e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}+P=1$ and subtract the power term from both sides, $P=$1-\e^{-0.0024-0.0053x}.</p>
          <h3>B.</h3>
          <p>Set $x=2019$, $C(x) = 353(1.006)^{2019-1990}$, $C(x)=419.87\ldots$. Calculate the percent increase, $\left( \displaystyle\frac{419.87\ldots}{300} -1 \right) \times 100 = 39.95\ldots \approx 40%$. The atmospheric CO2 concentration is 40% higher in 2019 than the historical maximum.</p>

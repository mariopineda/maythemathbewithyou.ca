        <h3>A.</h3>
        <p>Since at the x-intercept $y=0$ and at the y-intercept $x=0$ we have the following two points, $(5,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Using these points we can determine the slope of the line, $m=\frac{\displaystyle 0-1}{\displaystyle 5-0}=-\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 5}$. We can now express the equation of the line is slope y-intercept form as $y=-\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 5}x+1$. We can convert the slope y-intercept form to general form as follows,
          $$
            \begin{array}{rcll}
                                                            y & = & -\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 5}x+1 &  \\
                -\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 5}x-y+1 & = & 0 & \mbox{Subtract y from both sides and reverse LHS and RHS} \\
                (-5) \times \left(-\frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle 5}x-y+1 \right) & = & 0 \times (-5) & \mbox{Multiply both sides by -5 to eliminate negative fraction} \\
                x+5y-5 & = & 0 & \mbox{Apply distributive property on the LHS}
            \end{array}
          $$
        </p>
        <h3>B.</h3>
        <p>Convert $3x-y+5=0$ to slope y-intercept form to determine the slope of the parallel line. Add $y$ to both sides results in $y=3x+5$ where the slope $m=3$. Since parallel lines have the same slopes $m=m_{\parallel}=3$. Since $f(1)=5 \Rightarrow$ represents the point $(1,5)$ we can now subsitute in the slope, the given point into the slope y-intercept form and solve for the y-intercept ($b$),
          $$
            \begin{array}{rcll}
              y & = & mx+b \\
              5 & = & 3 \times 1 + b & \mbox{Substitue in known values} \\
              5-3 & = & b & \mbox{Add -3 to both sides} \\
              2 & = & b & \mbox{Simplify}
            \end{array}
          $$
          We can now express the equation of the line in slope y-intercept form as $y=3x+2$ and in general form as $3x-y+2=0$.

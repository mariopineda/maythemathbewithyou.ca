<p>The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C was published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on 8 October 2018. The report includes over 6,000 scientific references, and was prepared by 91 authors from 40 countries. Its key finding is that meeting a 1.5 °C target is possible but would require "deep emissions reductions" and "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." The report estimates that there is a 66% probability of stay below the 1.5 °C target by making immediate and drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

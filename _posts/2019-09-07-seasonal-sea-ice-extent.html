<p>The amount of sea ice in the arctic varies seasonally and for the year 2018 it can be modelled by the cubic function $A(m) = 0.069x^3 - 1.3x^2 + 6.04x + 6.73$ where $m$ represents the month (January is month 1 and December is month 12) and $A$ represents the area of the sea ice in millions of square kilometers.</p>
<ol type="A">
  </li>Sketch the function describing the extent of sea ice. Label the axes and key points. </li>
  <li>Determine the maximum area of sea ice coverage to the nearest thousand of a million square kilometer.</li>
  <li>Determine the minimum area of sea ice coverage to the nearest thousand of a million square kilometer.</li>
  <li>Determine during which month the the sea ice covers the largest area.</li>
  <li>Determine during which month the the sea ice covers the smallest area.</li>
  <li>What is an appropriate domain and range for this context?</li>
</ol>

          <p>If $n$ is a whole number, then $2n$ is an even number and $2n+(2n+2)+(2n+4)+(2n+6)+(2n+8)+(2n+10)$ is a sum of six consequtive even numbers. This expression can be simplified to: $12n+30 = 6(2n+5)$. Since we were able to factor out 6 it means the sum must be divisible by 6.</p>

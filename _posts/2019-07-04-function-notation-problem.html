<p>Per capita GDP is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross domestic product by its total population. The per capita GDP is often used as a measure of a country's standard of living. It tells you, on average, how financially and socially prosperous a country's citizens are. The estimated global cost to humanity from global warming is described by $G(t) = 22588 - 168.05472 \times t^2$ where $t$ is average temperature increase in degrees Celcius (C&deg;) and $G(t)$ is the predicted global per capita GDP (in Canadian dollars).</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Graph $G(t)$, $x:\{0, 8, 1\}$, $y:\{0, 23000, 1000\}$ on your graphing calculator and sketch the graph.</li>
  <li>Determine the value $G(6)$. Explain what the result represents in this context. Round answer to nearest whole number.</li>
  <li>What is the per capita GDP if the temperature does not increase due to global warming?</li>
  <li>What amount of temperature increase will result in the per capita GDP being reduced by half? Round your answer to the nearest whole number.</li>
</ol>

          <li>$G(6) = 22588 - 168.05472 \times 6^2 \Rightarrow G(6)=16538.03008 \approx \boxed{16538}$. A 6C&deg; increase in the average temperature will result in a per capita GDP of 16538 dollars.</li>
          <li>Set $t=0 \Rightarrow G(0) = 22588 - 168.05472 \times 0^2 \Rightarrow G(0) = 22588$. The per capita GDP if the temperature does not increase is 22588 dollars.</li>
          <li>The per capita GDP with no temperature increase is 22588 dollars. Half of this is $22588 \div 2 = 11294$ dollars. Set $G(t)=11294 \Rightarrow 11294=22588 - 168.05472 \times t^2$ and solve for the temperature, $t$.
$$11294 = 22588-168.05472 \times t^2$$
$$11294-22588 = -168.05472 \times t^2$$
$$-11294 = -168.05472 \times t^2$$
$$\frac{-11294}{-168.05472} = \frac{-168.05472}{-168.05472} \times t^2$$
$$67.204... = t^2$$
$$\sqrt{67.204...} = \sqrt{t^2}$$
$$8.197... = t$$
$$\boxed{t \approx 8}$$
A temperature increase of 8C&deg; will result in the per capita GDP being reduced by half.

The Oxford Word of the Year is a word or expression shown through usage evidence to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year, and have lasting potential as a term of cultural significance.

The Oxford Word of the Year 2019 is climate emergency.

Climate emergency is defined as ‘a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it.’

This year, heightened public awareness of climate science and the myriad implications for communities around the world has generated enormous discussion of what the UN Secretary-General has called ‘the defining issue of our time’.

But it is not just this upsurge in conversation that has caught our attention. Our research reveals a demonstrable escalation in the language people are using to articulate information and ideas concerning the climate. This is most clearly encapsulated by the rise of climate emergency in 2019.

          <p>Number of arrangements of 4 digit suffix bands: $1 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^4$. There is only one choice for the prefix. Number of arrangements of 5 digit suffix bands: $1 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^5$. Total number of arrangements $10^4 + 10^5 = 110000$ possible arrangements.</p>

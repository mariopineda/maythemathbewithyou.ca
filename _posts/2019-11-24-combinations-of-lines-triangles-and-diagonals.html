  <p>Given the following arrangements of points with no 3 collinear, determine:</p>
  <ol type="A">
    <li>the number of lines that can be drawn through the points.</li>
    <li>the number of triangles that can be formed with the points as vertices.</li>
    <li>the number of diagonals that can be formed, assuming that a diagonal is a line segement connecting two vertices and passing through the intrior of the shape (not along the perimeter).</li>

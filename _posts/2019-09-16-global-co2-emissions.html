<p>Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from human activities are now higher than at any point in our history. Recent data reveals that global CO₂ emissions were 150 times higher in 2011 than they were in 1850. The global CO₂ emissions between 1850 and 2014 can be modelled with the following exponential function $e(t) = 260*1.0303^t$ where $t$ is the year since 1850 and $e(t)$ is the global CO₂ emissions in megatonnes.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Sketch the function, label the axes and indicate your window settings.</li>
  <li>What year did the global CO₂ emisions exceed 1 billion tonnes?</li>
  <li>State a possible domain and range for the exponential function in this context.</li>
</ol>

            <li>After graphing $y(x)$ add $y_2=2.2$ and find the x-coordinate of the point of intersection between ther two graphs (2nd+trace $\Rightarrow$ 5:intersect). The distance at which the lead concentration is back at background levels is 105 km away from the upgrading facility.</li>

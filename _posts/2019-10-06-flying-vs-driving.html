<p>Climate change is one of the most important environmental issues of our time. Climate change is caused by the increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These increases are primarily due to human activities such as the use of fossil fuels or agriculture. In 2017, the transportation sector was the second largest source of GHG emissions in Canada, accounting for 24% (174 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) of total national emissions.<p>

<p>An average airliner with 100 passengers flying between Edmonton and Vancouver emits 13 tonnes of CO2. Driving a car between Edmonton and Vancouver emits 186 kg of CO2. 1 tonnes = 1000 kg.</p>

<ol type="A">
<li>Find the unit rate of CO2 emissions per person for the two modes of transport (kg CO2 emissions / person). Which mode of transport has the lowest amount of emissions?</li>
<li>Find the rate of CO2 emissions for a family of four person for the two modes of transport (kg CO2 emissions / 4 persons). Which mode of transport has the lowest amount of emissions?</li>
</ol>

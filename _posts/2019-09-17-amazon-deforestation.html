<p>All major tropical forests, including those in the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia and Indonesia, are disappearing to make way for human food production such as livestock and crops. The deforestation of tropical rain forests has profound and devstating consequences that affect the whole world, including social conflict, human rights abuse, extinction of plans and animals and climate change.</p>

<p>The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world representing over half of Earth's tropical rainforests. More species are found here than anywhere else on Earth. Large areas of the Amazon forest is clearcut every year and converted to cattle ranching to produce meat and leather for the international market. Since 1970, 20% (792051 km$^2$, about the area of Pakistan) of the Amazon rainforest has disappeared. The estimated remaining forest cover in the Brazilian Amazon in 2017 was 3315849 km$^2$ and in 2018 it was 3307949 km$^2$.</p>

<ol type="A">
  <li>Determine the common ratio, to the nearest thousandth, for the years 2017 and 2018.</li>
  <li>Determine the rate, to the nearest thousandth, at which the area of the rainforest is decreasing.</li>
  <li>Write the exponential equation that represents this situation, where $A(t)$ is the area of the forest cover in square kilometers in year $t$.</li>
  <li>Using your model, predict the area of the forest that will remain in 2030. Round your answer to the nearest whole square kilometer.</li>
  <li>Calculate the total area, to the nearest square kilometer, of forest lost between 2019 and 2020.</li>
</ol>

            <li><img src="http://maythemathbewithyou.com/calculator/global-co2-emissions.png" width "100%"><p>The t-axis represents years since 1850 and the e-axis represents global annual CO₂ emissions in megatonnes. The window settings are $X:[0, 164, 10]$ and $Y:[0, 35000, 1000]$.</p></li>
            <li>Domain: $\{t | 0 \leq t \leq 164, t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ Range: $\{e | 0 \leq e \leq 34755.2262, e \in \mathbb{R} \}$.</li>
            <li>The answer to this question will depend on your birth year and today's date. If you were born in 2000, $t=2000-1850=150$ and the emission in that year were $e(150) = 260 \times 1.0303^{150} \Rightarrow e(150)=22883.8094$ megatonnes. If today's year is 2019, $t=2019-1850=169$ and the emission are $e(169) = 260 \times 1.0303^{169} \Rightarrow e(150)=40349.54284$ megatonnes. Using the provided formula, $\displaystyle\frac{40349.54284 - 22883.8094}{22883.8094} \times 100 = 76.3235...$. The CO₂ emissions are projected to have increased 76% between the years 2000 and 2019.
            <li>The prediction is an extrapolation since the model is used to predict the emissions beyond the years for which it was calibrated (1850-2014). Caution needs to be taken when interpreting predictions based on extrapolation as the assumption one is making is that the trend described by the function continues beyond the data that was used to create the function. </li>

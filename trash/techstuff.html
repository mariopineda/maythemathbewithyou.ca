<p>This website was handcrafted lovingly and mindfully using the most versatile, most low tech and most powerful Open Source tools of the trade. Why would one want to do this when you could use the latest version of [<em>insert name of any propritary, expensive and bloated software</em>]? Because...
<ul>
<li>simple is beautful, less likely to break, easier to fix when it does break and comes with no unwanted baggage.</li>
<li>Open Source is fair and free (free as in freedom and as in your favourite beverage).</li>
<li>Open Source is socially responsible and immensely powerful.</li>
<li>I am a computer nerd taking pleasure in crafting code in a terminal window.</li>
</ul>
